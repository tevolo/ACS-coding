<h1>US-China Workshops for Early Career Chemical Researchers</h1>
<p>During the week of October 26, 2009, a delegation of highly esteemed early-career scientists from the US traveled to Beijing to take part in parallel workshops on New Materials (with sub-themes including: Energy, Nano and Bio/Medicinal Chemistry) and Supramolecular Chemistry. These workshops, funded jointly by a grant from the US National Science Foundation (US NSF) and the Chinese National Natural Science Foundation (NSFC), aim to foster long-term collaborative relationships between promising early career researchers from the US and China, to tackle jointly some of the most daunting challenges facing the world today.<br>

The workshop agenda was arranged in such a way that each of the three days focused on one sub-theme, with time reserved each afternoon for open moderated discussion. Presentations from the US and China included impressive cutting-edge technologies and advancements in clean energy, nanomaterials for improved drug delivery, synthesis of biologically-inspired molecules and other exciting developments in the areas of focus. For a list of participants, including bios and abstracts, as well as other information from the workshop, please see the meeting <u><!-- TRANSIT - HYPERLINK --><!-- ./PublicWebSite/membership/acs/welcoming/international/regional/eventsasiapacific/CNBP_023428. --><!-- .._blank. --><a href="/PublicWebSite/membership/acs/welcoming/international/regional/eventsasiapacific/CNBP_023428" target="_blank">proceedings</a></u><span class="pdf-icon">.</span><br>

Researchers from the US and China provided compelling presentations in areas such as controlled self-assembly and disassembly, design of functional materials, supramolecular gels and more. Afternoon open discussions included the sharing of ideas related to the technical aspects of research in supramolecular chemistry as well as the unique contributions of supramolecular chemistry to the chemical sciences and ways that supramolecular chemists could contribute to other fields while benefitting from interdisciplinary collaborations.</p>
